# Snake Game

**Snake Game** is a classic game developed as part of **Task 4** for my **Future Intern internship**. This project implements the classic Snake Game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Spring Boot. The game is designed to be engaging and easy to play directly from a web browser.

## Tech Stack

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Implementing the traditional Snake game mechanics with smooth and responsive controls.
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score display and updates as the game progresses.
- **Game Over Handling**: Shows a popup with the final score and the option to restart the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the game interface is functional and visually appealing on various device sizes.
- **Sound Effects**: Audio cues for eating food and game over events.

## Usage

## API Endpoints

The Snake Game does not utilize traditional API endpoints but is served as a static HTML file with associated assets. The game logic and assets are all handled client-side with JavaScript and server-side with Spring Boot for serving the static content.
